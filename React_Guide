React:


App.js and Index.js

The above mentioned files are dependent each other in such a way that the index.js will have the root element with this component.

Index.js:  Starting of the react app. It allows react code to our HTML page.

 => const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));

		document.getElementById("root") looks for a <div id="root"></div> in your public/index.html file.

		React uses that <div> as the mount point — the place where your app lives in the browser.

		ReactDOM allows react to interact with web browser DOM(Document Object Model)

 => root.render(
  		<React.StrictMode>
    		<App />
  		</React.StrictMode>
	);	

	This above code will help react to render the app component into html page which present in public/index.html inside <div id="root">
