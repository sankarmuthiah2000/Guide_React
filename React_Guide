React:


App.js and Index.js

The above mentioned files are dependent each other in such a way that the index.js will have the root element with this component.

Index.js:  Starting of the react app. It allows react code to our HTML page.

 => const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));

		document.getElementById("root") looks for a <div id="root"></div> in your public/index.html file.

		React uses that <div> as the mount point — the place where your app lives in the browser.

		ReactDOM allows react to interact with web browser DOM(Document Object Model)

 => root.render(
  		<React.StrictMode>
    		<App />
  		</React.StrictMode>
	);	

	This above code will help react to render the app component into html page which present in public/index.html inside <div id="root">

ReactDOM:

   This is mainly used to convert virtual DOM created by react into browser HTML page.
   Think about this scenario Brower only accepts HTML pages to view but in react we have java script which is gonna embeded with html pages.
   At the runtime reactDOM is responsible for rendering those as a browsers real dom.

DOM: Document object model
   It is not a html page or react or javascript code. 
   DOM is nothing but a tree representation of an html file. In the form of javascript can access and modify.

   Document
   └── html
      └── body
           ├── h1
           │    └── "Hello"
           └── p
                └── "Welcome"
